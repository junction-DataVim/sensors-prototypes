# Placeholder for TOC/BOD Sensor Circuit Diagram

This is a placeholder for the Fritzing circuit diagram showing the connections between:
- ESP32 development board
- TOC sensor (UV-Persulfate or High-Temperature Combustion)
- BOD sensor (Optical or Electrochemical)
- DS18B20 temperature sensor
- Sample valve control
- Reagent pump control
- Sample heater control
- Status LED
- Power management circuit

The actual Fritzing diagram (.fzz file) should be created separately and exported as PNG.
