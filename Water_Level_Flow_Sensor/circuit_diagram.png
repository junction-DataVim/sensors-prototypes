# Placeholder for Water Level and Flow Sensor Circuit Diagram

This is a placeholder for the Fritzing circuit diagram showing the connections between:
- ESP32 development board
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor
- YF-S201 hall effect flow sensor
- DS18B20 temperature sensor
- Pump control relay
- Status LED
- Power management circuit

The actual Fritzing diagram (.fzz file) should be created separately and exported as PNG.
