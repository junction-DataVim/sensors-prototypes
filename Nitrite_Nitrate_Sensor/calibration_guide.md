## Standard Solutions

### Nitrite Standards
**Stock Solution (1000 mg/L NO₂⁻)**
- 1.499 g NaNO₂ (sodium nitrite) in 1000 mL DI water
- Store at 4°C, stable for 1 month

**Working Standards**
- 0.1 mg/L: 0.1 mL stock + 999.9 mL DI water
- 1.0 mg/L: 1.0 mL stock + 999.0 mL DI water
- 10.0 mg/L: 10.0 mL stock + 990.0 mL DI water

### Nitrate Standards
**Stock Solution (1000 mg/L NO₃⁻)**
- 1.371 g KNO₃ (potassium nitrate) in 1000 mL DI water
- Store at 4°C, stable for 6 months

**Working Standards**
- 1.0 mg/L: 1.0 mL stock + 999.0 mL DI water
- 10.0 mg/L: 10.0 mL stock + 990.0 mL DI water
- 100.0 mg/L: 100.0 mL stock + 900.0 mL DI water

## Ionic Strength Adjustment Solution (ISAS)
**For Nitrite**
- 58.5 g NaCl + 4.0 g Na₂SO₄ in 1000 mL DI water
- Adjust pH to 7.0 with NaOH/HCl

**For Nitrate**
- 58.5 g NaCl + 2.0 g KCl in 1000 mL DI water
- Adjust pH to 7.0 with NaOH/HCl

## Calibration Procedure

### Pre-Calibration Setup
1. **Electrode Conditioning**
   - Soak electrodes in 0.1 M KCl for 30 minutes
   - Rinse with DI water
   - Blot dry with lint-free tissue

2. **Temperature Stabilization**
   - Ensure all solutions at room temperature (20-25°C)
   - Allow electrodes to equilibrate for 15 minutes

3. **Equipment Check**
   - Verify meter zero and calibration
   - Check electrode connections
   - Test stirring mechanism

### Nitrite Calibration
1. **Blank Measurement**
   - Measure DI water + ISAS
   - Record baseline voltage
   - Should be stable within ±0.5 mV

2. **Standard Measurements**
   - Start with lowest concentration (0.1 mg/L)
   - Add 100 mL standard to beaker
   - Add 1 mL ISAS, stir gently
   - Insert electrodes, avoid air bubbles
   - Wait for stable reading (±0.1 mV for 30 seconds)
   - Record voltage and temperature
   - Repeat for all standards

3. **Calibration Curve**
   - Plot voltage vs. log[NO₂⁻]
   - Expected slope: -59.16 mV/decade at 25°C
   - Acceptable range: -54 to -64 mV/decade
   - Correlation coefficient: R² > 0.998

### Nitrate Calibration
1. **Blank Measurement**
   - Measure DI water + ISAS
   - Record baseline voltage

2. **Standard Measurements**
   - Start with lowest concentration (1.0 mg/L)
   - Add 100 mL standard to beaker
   - Add 1 mL ISAS, stir gently
   - Insert electrodes, avoid air bubbles
   - Wait for stable reading (±0.1 mV for 30 seconds)
   - Record voltage and temperature
   - Repeat for all standards

3. **Calibration Curve**
   - Plot voltage vs. log[NO₃⁻]
   - Expected slope: -59.16 mV/decade at 25°C
   - Acceptable range: -54 to -64 mV/decade
   - Correlation coefficient: R² > 0.998

## Quality Control

### Acceptance Criteria
- Slope within ±10% of theoretical value
- Intercept stable within ±5 mV
- Response time < 2 minutes
- Reproducibility < 5% RSD

### Verification
1. **Mid-point Check**
   - Measure a standard not used in calibration
   - Accuracy should be within ±5%

2. **Detection Limit**
   - Measure 10 blanks
   - Calculate 3σ detection limit
   - Should be < 0.05 mg/L for nitrite
   - Should be < 0.5 mg/L for nitrate

3. **Interference Check**
   - Test with common interferents
   - Chloride: < 10% error at 100x concentration
   - Sulfate: < 10% error at 50x concentration

## Troubleshooting

### Poor Slope Response
- Check electrode age and condition
- Verify standard solution concentrations
- Ensure proper ionic strength adjustment
